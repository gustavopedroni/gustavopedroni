## Hi 👋 I am Gustavo! 
I am a developer who is passionate about working as a team and making things happen. Few tech that I enjoy working in are Python, Django, Node.js, and AWS. I am actively looking for opportunities in software/web development. Recently, I have just started text-based RPG!
- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently working, learning and growing my skillset in data structures, patterns, algorithms and devops tools (why not? 🤔).
- 🤝 Open for collaborations in any projects.
