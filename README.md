## Hi 👋 I am Gustavo! 
I'm a developer passionate about learning about development and I love working as a team to solve things. Few tech that I enjoy working in are Python, Django, Node.js, and AWS. I am actively looking for opportunities in software/web development. Recently, I have just started text-based RPG!
- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently working, learning and growing my skillset in data structures, patterns, algorithms and devops tools (why not? 🤔).
- 🤝 Open for collaborations on any project, just send me a message 😉.
